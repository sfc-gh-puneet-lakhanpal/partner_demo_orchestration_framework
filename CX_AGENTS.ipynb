**Safety Concerns**: Users frequently report feeling unsafe and uncomfortable when the license plate does not match, leading to ride cancellations and a reluctance to use the service in the future.\\n   - **Inconvenience**: Users often have to wait for another ride or find alternative transportation, causing delays and frustration.\\n   - **Recurring Issues**: Multiple users have experienced this issue more than once, indicating a persistent problem that needs to be addressed.\\n   - **Driver Concerns**: Drivers are worried about the app displaying incorrect license plate information, which can negatively impact their ratings and interactions with passengers.\\n\\n2. **Emergency Route Deviation**:\\n   - **Emergency Route Failures**: The emergency route deviation feature frequently failed to provide alternate routes during emergencies, leading to significant delays and stress for both drivers and passengers.\\n   -
